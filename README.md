# 🧪 Basic Unit Testing in Swift (Xcode 15)

This project is created as part of my learning journey to understand and implement **unit testing** in iOS development using **Swift** and **Xcode 15**.

## 📌 Purpose

- To learn the basics of writing unit tests using `XCTest`.
- To understand how to test ViewModels and logic in Swift.
- To practice common testing scenarios such as:
  - Checking array counts
  - Validating boolean flags
  - Writing clear and readable test cases

## 🚀 Features

- Simple `ViewModel` with item management logic
- Example unit tests to verify `removeLast()` functionality
- Tests for:
  - Decreasing array count
  - Enabling/disabling buttons based on array state

## 📁 Project Structure

- `ItemViewModel.swift` – Holds the logic for managing items
- `Item.swift` – Basic data model with sample data
- `ItemAppTests.swift` – Unit test cases using `XCTest`

## 🛠 Tools Used

- Swift 5
- Xcode 15
- XCTest Framework

## 💡 Learning Goal

Understand how to:
- Write unit tests from scratch
- Use assertions like `XCTAssertEqual`, `XCTAssertTrue`, and `XCTAssertFalse`
- Structure test cases clearly
